As I suspected, the difference in language along with accents that are used in Spanish made things messy.  There were, however, some key-values free of error such as country and state.  For simplicity, I chose to focus on the following keys:\n",

For example, 'GUADALAJARA JALISCO', 'Guadalajara Jalisco', and 'Guadalajara, Jalisco'. These types of errors occurred in only a few of the main municipalities in the Guadalajara area and were corrected with a simple search and replace function. To make sure that other city names were legitimate, I scraped data from a wikipedia page containing city names in the state of Jalisco and compared them with those encountered in the OpenStreetMap file (see `scrape_cities.py`). If the city name was not in this list, it was omitted.  Below is an audit of the city names containing the word 'Guadalajara'."

    "Some city names were completely out of place such as 'Morelia' which is not in the state of Jaliso.  There were also inconsistencies with spelling, accents, capitalization, and the inclusion of the state name along with the city name. For example, 'GUADALAJARA JALISCO', 'Guadalajara Jalisco', and 'Guadalajara, Jalisco'. These types of errors occurred in only a few of the main municipalities in the Guadalajara area and were corrected with a simple search and replace function. To make sure that other city names were legitimate, I scraped data from a wikipedia page containing city names in the state of Jalisco and compared them with those encountered in the OpenStreetMap file (see `scrape_cities.py`). If the city name was not in this list, it was omitted.  Below is an audit (value and number of occurrences) of the city names containing the word 'Guadalajara'."
